== Hibernate in Liberty

Tests checking various reported differences between Hibernate and EclipseLink (as the default provider for Liberty) as an analysis of migrating to usage of Hibernate in Liberty.

The tests assume a running SQL Server instance based on the container definitions from the http://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm[Hibernate ORM] project.

Change `ormVersion` in `build.gradle` to test with various versions.
